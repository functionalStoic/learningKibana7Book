------------------------------------------------Installing Plugin------------------------------------------------

We need to move in Kibana home directory, as we need to run the /bin/kibana-plugin command to install the plugins. If we know the name or URL of the plugin which is compatible with the installed version of Kibana then we can install it using the following command:

bin/kibana-plugin install <plugin name or URL>

When we provide the URL, Kibana downloads the plugin from that URL but when we provide the name Kibana plugin tool tries to download it from official Elastic plugin directory. For example, the x-pack plugin which is an official Elastic plugin so we can install it using the following command:

bin/kibana-plugin install x-pack

This way we can install any compatible plugin to extend the features of Kibana. To update the plugin we need to remove and uninstall it again. Now let us see how we can remove the plugin.


------------------------------------------------Removing Plugin------------------------------------------------

We can remove the plugin by passing remove keyword with plugin name to the bin/kibana-plugin command. For example, if we want to remove the x-pack plugin then we can execute the following command:

bin/kibana-plugin remove x-pack

We can also remove the plugin manually by deleting the plugin's subdirectory from plugins/ directory.
